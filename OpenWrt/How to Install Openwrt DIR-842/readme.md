## Get started

 Visit [OpenWrt Firmware Selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/) on your local machine.

### Downloading Custom OpenWrt Images  

With OpenWrt Firmware Selector now we can customize which packages to be installed. In this guide I will be adding `luci-app-attendedsysupgrade`,  `luci-proto-relay` & `luci`.

2. Unplug power from the device
3. Press and hold the reset button on the device and re-plug the power without releasing the reset button
4. Continue to hold the reset button until the red/orange power light starts blinking
5. On the computer, manually assign a static IP address on the 192.168.0.xxx subnet, other than 192.168.0.1 (e.g. 192.168.0.2)
6. Open a web browser and navigate to <http://192.168.0.1>

7. Click `Browse..` and choose the `factory.bin` and click on `Upload`  
8. After the file has been uploaded, you should see a ‚ÄúDevice is upgrading the firmware‚Äù message on the web browser  
9. Wait while the device verify the uploaded file and flash the firmware  
10. The device will reboot automatically after the flashing process finishes. DO NOT turn off the router

    | *Set static IP* |  
11. After a while set your PC to 192.168.1.2 with default gateway 192.168.1.1.  

### Part ‚Ö° : Upgrading OpenWrt firmware in LUCI

1. Open a web browser and navigate to <http://192.168.1.1>  
2. Log in to the OpenWrt web interface using the default username and password (usually "root" and a blank password, respectively).  

    | ![luci-flash1](./luci-flash1.png)  |  
    |:--:|  
    | *LuCI dropdown menu* |
3. `System` > `Backup / Flash Firmware`  

    | ![luci-flash2](./luci-flash2.png) |  
    |:--:|  
    | *LuCI flash operations* |
4. Click on `Flash Image..`  
5. Choose the `factory.bin` and click on ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù
6. The system will reboot
7. That's it! You should now be able to use OpenWrt on your D-Link DIR-842 C2 router.  

### Additional Notes

> Note that flashing a new firmware onto a router can be risky and may result in the loss of all data on the router if something goes wrong. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and take all necessary precautions to avoid damaging your router.
